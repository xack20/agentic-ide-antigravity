# Exploring Software Architecture and Design Patterns

This repository is a collection of projects, each demonstrating a different software architectural style, design pattern, or system design. The goal is to provide practical, hands-on examples of various approaches to building software.

## Architectural Designs

This section contains examples of different architectural patterns.

### 1. 3-Tier Architecture

*   **Description:** A traditional client-server architecture that separates the application into three logical and physical computing tiers: the presentation tier, the application tier, and the data tier.
*   **Implementation:** The `3tier-approach/user-management` directory contains a user management service built with this architecture.

*I will add more sections here as I add more design patterns and architectural examples.*
